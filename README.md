# DS23IterativeReweightedLeasSquares

The aim of the project was to implement Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimisation algorithm for parameter estimation in Logistic Regression (LR). 
Moreover, the implementation includes an additional functionality based on the possibility of adding interactions between two variables. 
This repository contains the implementation of the method in the form of the working R package. It includes the documentation of the most important functions. 
The report with the outcomes analysis is available in the main folder, whereas the source codes for the experiments as well as rendered html reports are in the 
vignettes folder.

# Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub with the usage of devtools package.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("HubertR21/DS23IterativeReweightedLeasSquares")
```
